PHOTOWALK
=========

Command line photography workflow program which is intended to be a tool 
for a traveling light photographer and preprocessing tool before using 
a full-featured workflow program like Darktable or Aftershot Pro.

# All this commented stuff i.e. everything is missing from the golang 
# version. Work in progress, you see.
#
# - Copies images to YYYY/MM/DDDD directory tree.
# - Rotates JPG's according to EXIF data.
# - Resizes JPG's, to free Picasaweb maximum size 2048 px.
# - EXIF-data is updated when needed in resizing and rototation.

DEPENDENCIES

- golang 1.3 (Might work with earlier releases, though, but it is not
supported.)

TODO

The features I really want to have.

- IPTC-data
- Documentation which is usable for other people.
- Renaming templates.
- Geotagging
- Cleaning, including an own PhotowalkImage class
- RAW-support
- Logging
- Picasa export
- DVD backups
- do things in plugins

IDEAS

The feature that might be nice. Some of them might not even be possible in a 
command line software.

- Distortion correction via Lensfun.
- Transveral chromatic aberration correction via Lensfun.
- Vignettin correction via Lensfun. 
- Colour contribution of the lens (correcdting said "yellowish" or "blueish" 
images.
- libraw usage.
