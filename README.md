PHOTOWALK
=========

Command line photography workflow program which is intended to be a tool 
for a traveling light photographer and preprocessing tool before using 
a full-featured workflow program like Darktable or Aftershot Pro.

# All this commented stuff i.e. everything is missing from the golang
# version. Work in progress, you see.
#
# - Copies images to YYYY/MM/DDDD directory tree.
# - Rotates JPG's according to EXIF data.
# - Resizes JPG's, to free Picasaweb maximum size 2048 px.
# - EXIF-data is updated when needed in resizing and rototation.

command line software.

- Distortion correction via Lensfun.
- Transveral chromatic aberration correction via Lensfun.

- Colour contribution of the lens (correcdting said "yellowish" or "blueish" 
images.
- libraw usage.
<<<<<<< HEAD
